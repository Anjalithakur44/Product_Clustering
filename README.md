# Product_Clustering
This project involves clustering products based on customer purchasing data using K-means. The clustering helps identify product segments for strategic decision-making.

## Dataset
- **File**: `online_retail_II.csv`, **Link**: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mashlyn/online-retail-ii-uci/data
- **Description**: Contains transactional data, including quantities, prices, and customer information.

 ## Key Steps
1. **Data Cleaning**: Processed missing values and removed duplicates.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Created features for total quantity, average price, and total revenue per product.
3. **Clustering**: Applied K-Means clustering and evaluated results using the silhouette score.
4. **Visualization**: Generated visual representations to analyze clusters.

## Code
The complete code is available in `Product_Clustering_KMeans.ipynb`.

## Results
Identified clusters allow for targeted marketing strategies based on product demand and pricing.

## Requirements
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `scikit-learn`
